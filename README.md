# healthcare-rcm-pipeline
This repository contains a scalable data pipeline for Healthcare Revenue Cycle Management (RCM), focusing on claims processing and denials management. The project is designed to handle file-based batch processing (MVP) and will evolve to support HL7 interfaces, EDI API integrations, and real-time streaming using Kafka, Spark, and Airflow.
